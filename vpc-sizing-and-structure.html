  <h1>VPC Sizing and Structure Knowledge Takeaways</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This lesson focuses on designing a well-structured and scalable network inside AWS using a VPC. It emphasizes the
    importance of planning an IP plan for a business, especially when running in AWS.</p>

  <h2>Key Considerations for VPC Design</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP Range Selection:</strong> Deciding on the IP range (CIDR) for the VPC is crucial as it's not easy to
      change later.</li>
    <li><strong>VPC Size:</strong> The size of the VPC influences how many services can fit into it. Each service
      occupies space inside the VPC with one or more IPs.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Interaction:</strong> Consider other networks you'll interact with to avoid overlapping or
      duplicate ranges which could complicate communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Future Growth:</strong> Predict future needs and changes in the network structure to accommodate growth.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>VPC Structure Breakdown</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tiers:</strong> IT networks typically have tiers like web, application, and database tiers. These tiers
      separate components and allow different security applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Availability Zones:</strong> Networks are often split across availability zones for resiliency.</li>
    <li><strong>Subnet Allocation:</strong> Each tier should have its own subnet in each Availability Zone. For example,
      four Availability Zones would mean four subnets per tier (web, app, DB, spare).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>VPC Sizing Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Micro VPC:</strong> A /24 VPC with eight /27 subnets, totaling 216 IP addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>Extra Large VPC:</strong> A /16 VPC with sixteen /20 subnets, totaling over 65,000 IP addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>Subnet Calculation:</strong> If starting with a /16 VPC, splitting into 16 subnets results in /20
      subnets, each with 4,091 IP addresses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Designing for Animals4Life Organization</h2>
  <p>The design process considered the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Avoided Ranges:</strong> Specific ranges were avoided due to existing usage in other networks (e.g.,
      192.168.10.0/24, 10.0.0.0/16, 172.31.0.0/16).</li>
    <li><strong>Preferred Range:</strong> Used the 10.x.y.z range but avoided common subnets like 10.0 to 10.10.</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Allocation:</strong> Allocated specific /16 blocks for regions (US, Europe, Australia),
      ensuring non-overlapping ranges.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Segregation:</strong> Each AWS account (General, Prod, Dev, Reserved) received four /16 ranges
      per region, allowing for multiple VPCs.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> A downloadable PDF document was provided detailing the IP plan structure. This document
      serves as a foundational reference for large AWS deployments and includes allocated ranges for each region and
      account.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Designing a VPC involves careful planning of IP ranges, considering current and future needs, avoiding overlaps,
    and structuring subnets based on tiers and availability zones. This structured approach ensures scalability and
    resilience in AWS environments.</p>
